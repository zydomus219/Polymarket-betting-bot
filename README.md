A sophisticated trading bot that monitors and replicates trading positions from specified wallets on Polymarket, with configurable execution parameters and risk management.

---

## 🧩 About

The Polymarket Trade Copier is an enterprise-grade trading bot designed to observe and replicate trading activities from target wallets on the Polymarket platform. It leverages blockchain event monitoring to detect trades in real-time and executes similar positions with configurable parameters through the Polymarket Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) API.


**Motivation:** Mirror successful trading strategies from proven market participants, automate position taking with customizable execution parameters, and implement sophisticated order execution with fallback mechanisms.

**Key goals:**
- Real-time blockchain event tracking for target wallets
- Parameterized position sizing and multi-stage order execution
- Balance verification, retry logic, and order lifecycle management

---

## ✨ Features

- **Blockchain event tracking** – Monitors Ethereum/Polygon for trading events from target wallets and validates transactions before copying
- **Parameterized position sizing** – Configurable ratio-based sizing relative to the target wallet (e.g. 0.1–0.3 for risk management)
- **Three-phase execution** – Primary order → price/size adjustment → final attempt with configurable timeouts and increments
- **Retry & lifecycle management** – Automatic retries with optimized parameters; cancels partially filled orders when needed
- **Interactive setup** – CLI prompts for target wallet, copy ratio, timeouts, and price increments
- **Balance & allowance checks** – USDC balance verification and token approval script for CLOB
- **Database integration** – Stores trade data (e.g. MongoDB) for analysis and record-keeping

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js (v14+)
- **Frameworks / libs:** ethers.js, Polymarket CLOB client, Mongoose
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Polygon (RPC + WebSocket)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, ts-node, Jest (testing)

## Professional Trading Bot for Automated Position Mirroring

A sophisticated trading application that monitors and replicates trading positions from specified wallets on Polymarket, with advanced execution parameters and risk management features.

This solution is ideal for traders looking to:
- Mirror successful trading strategies from proven market participants
- Automate position taking with customizable execution parameters
- Implement sophisticated order execution strategies with fallback mechanisms

## Core Capabilities

### Market Monitoring
- **Blockchain Event Tracking**: Monitors the Ethereum blockchain for specific trading events from target wallets
- **Transaction Validation**: Verifies successful transactions before attempting to copy positions
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Processes block data to extract relevant trade information including token IDs, sides, and amounts

### Trade Execution
- **Parameterized Position Sizing**: Configurable ratio-based position sizing relative to the target wallet
- **Multi-stage Execution Strategy**: Implements a three-tiered approach to order placement with progressive price adjustments
- **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed orders with optimized parameters
- **Order Lifecycle Management**: Monitors order status and cancels partially filled orders when necessary

### Configuration & Customization
- **Interactive Setup**: User-friendly command-line interface for configuring trading parameters
- **Flexible Execution Parameters**: Customizable timeouts, price adjustments, and retry limits
- **Balance Verification**: Integrates with USDC contract to verify sufficient funds before execution

## Technical Architecture

The application is built on a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Trade Monitor**: Listens for blockchain events and detects relevant trades
- **Trade Executor**: Handles order creation, submission, and management
- **CLOB Client**: Interfaces with the Polymarket API for order execution
- **Database Integration**: Stores trade data for analysis and record-keeping
- **Configuration Management**: Securely manages API credentials and trading parameters

## Implementation Details

### Order Execution Strategy

The bot employs a sophisticated three-phase execution strategy:

1. **Primary Execution Phase**:
   - Places an initial order mirroring the target's price point
   - Waits for a configurable timeout period for the order to fill
   - Proceeds to secondary phase if the order remains unfilled

2. **Secondary Adjustment Phase**:
   - Adjusts price by a configurable increment to improve fill probability
   - Slightly reduces position size to manage risk
   - Implements a separate timeout period for this phase

3. **Final Execution Phase**:
   - Makes a final price adjustment to maximize fill probability
   - Further reduces position size
   - Represents the last attempt to execute the trade

### Risk Management

- **Minimum Size Enforcement**: Ensures orders meet minimum size requirements
- **Value Thresholds**: Skips execution for trades below configurable value thresholds
- **Balance Verification**: Checks USDC balance before attempting trades
- **Position Sizing**: Implements proportional position sizing relative to target trades

## Setup & Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Ethereum wallet with sufficient USDC balance
- Polymarket API credentials
- Access to Polygon RPC and WebSocket endpoints

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file with the following parameters:
```
RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
WSS_URL=wss://polygon-ws.com
USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174
CLOB_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<polymarket_clob_contract_address>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
POLY_API_KEY=<your_polymarket_api_key>
POLY_PASSPHRASE=<your_polymarket_passphrase>
```

### Installation & Deployment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polymarket-trade-copier.git
cd polymarket-trade-copier

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the trading bot
npm start
```

### Trading Parameters Configuration
During startup, you'll be prompted to configure:

| Parameter | Description | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `targetWallet` | Wallet address to monitor | Use addresses with proven trading history |
| `copyRatio` | Position size ratio (0-1) | Start with lower values (0.1-0.3) for risk management |
| `retryLimit` | Maximum retry attempts | 3-5 is typically sufficient |
| `initialOrderTimeout` | First attempt timeout (seconds) | 30-60 seconds recommended |
| `secondOrderIncrement` | Price adjustment for second attempt (cents) | 1-3 cents depending on market volatility |
| `secondOrderTimeout` | Second attempt timeout (seconds) | 20-40 seconds recommended |
| `finalOrderIncrement` | Price adjustment for final attempt (cents) | 2-5 cents for maximum fill probability |
| `finalOrderTimeout` | Final attempt timeout (seconds) | 15-30 seconds recommended |

## Troubleshooting & Maintenance

### Common Issues

#### Insufficient Balance/Allowance
If you encounter "not enough balance / allowance" errors:
```bash
# Run the token approval script
npx ts-node src/scripts/runApproval.ts
```
This grants the CLOB contract permission to use your USDC for trading.

#### Invalid Order Payload
This typically indicates:
- Incorrect API credentials
- Attempting to cancel non-existent orders
- Malformed order parameters

Verify your API credentials and check the order parameters being submitted.

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Monitor USDC balance regularly
- Update API credentials when necessary
- Periodically review target wallet performance
- Adjust trading parameters based on market conditions

## Security Best Practices

- Store private keys in secure environment variables
- Use a dedicated trading wallet with limited funds
- Implement IP restrictions on API access where possible
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Regularly rotate API credentials
